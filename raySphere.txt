Ray:
====

Define a 3D ray as:
1. A 3D position O representing the ray's "origin".
2. A 3D direction D representing it's "direction".

Every 3D point along the ray can be defined as the ray's origin "displaced" by some amount in the ray's direction:

O + tD


Ray/Sphere Intersection:
==========================
Given a sphere as position S and a radius r, a ray could intersect it at 0, 1 or 2 positions.

Define a vector OS from the ray's origin to the sphere's center:

OS = S - O


There are then 2 commonly known approaches to find the intersection point(s):

| Approach 1:
==============
Define a position C along the ray, which is the closest to the sphere's center.

C = O + ocD

The distance oc is the projection of OS onto the ray direction D:

oc = OS⋅D

If this distance is not positive it means that C is 'behind' the ray's origin.
In other words, marching along the ray towards it from the ray's origin,
would be going "backwards" in the opposite direction of the ray direction D.
Only intersections in-front of the ray are valid so this case needs to be checked for.


Define a vector from C to the sphere's center S:

CS = S - C


It's length is the distance from C to the sphere's center S:

cs = ||CS||


Squaring that vector's length is equivalent to dotting it with itself:

cs² = ||CS||²
    = CS⋅CS

Define a delta d as the difference of squares of r and cs:

d = r² - cs²
r² = d + cs²

Position C could either be 'on' the sphere, 'inside' of it or 'outside' of it.
The sign of d can be used to determine which case applies, as follows:


1. C is outside the sphere:
---------------------------
The ray does not intersect the sphere.
The sphere's radius is smaller than it's distance of the closest position along the ray:

r < cs

Squaring both sides gives:
r² < cs²
d + cs² < cs²
d < cs² - cs²
d < 0

And so if d is negative, there is no intersection.


2. C is on the sphere:
----------------------
The ray is tangent to the sphere's surface intersecting it at C.
The sphere's radius is it's distance of the closest position along the ray:

r = cs
r² = cs²
d + cs² = cs²
d = cs² - cs²
d = 0

If d is zero, there is one intersection at C.


3. Inside:
----------
The distance of the closest position along the ray to the sphere's center is smaller than it's radius:

cs < r
cs² < r²

The ray intersects the sphere at 2 positions.
The sphere's radius is greater than it's distance of the closest position along the ray:

r > cs
r² > cs²
d + cs² > cs²
d > cs² - cs²
d > 0

If d is positive there are 2 intersections.

The 2 intersection positions are at equidistant from C along the ray forming right triangles with the sphere's center.
Define a distance ci from C to an intersection position I (using the pythagorean theorem):

r² = ci² + cs²
ci² = r² - cs²
ci² = d
ci = ±√d

These positive/negative distances along the ray, are from C towards each of the 2 intersection positions:
One going further along the ray from C, and the other going backwards along it from C by the same amount.
This delta can be defined as the absolute of distances ci:

|ci| = |±√d|
     = √d

Thus the distances of the 2 intersection positions are the the distance to C added/subtracted with this delta:

oi1 = oc + |ci|
oi2 = oc - |ci|

oi1 = oc + √d
oi2 = oc - √d

Either of these 2 intersection positions could be in front of the ray's origin, behind it or on it.
This will be reflected by either of the oi distances being positive, negative or zero.
Typically only intersection positions that are "in front" of the ray's position are of interest.
So only ones with positive distances can be considered.
If both are positive, the 'smaller' of them corresponds to the 'closest' intersection position,
which is typically the only one that matters (unless the sphere is transparent/translucent).
Additionally, if one of the distances oi1 and oi2 is positive but the other is negative,
it means that the ray origin itself is inside the sphere.
In that case, the positive distance is of an intersection tha hits the sphere's surface from the inside.
Typically this intersection is not desirable, and so there should "effectively" be no intersection.
Ultimately, the only valid case of an intersection, in when 'both' distances oi1 and oi2 are positive,
and it would be the smaller of the two (the closer intersection position).
The intersection position would then be:

I = O + min(oi1, oi2)D


Optimization:
-------------
Squaring that vector's length is equivalent to dotting it with itself:

cs² = ||CS||²
    = CS⋅CS

And so:

d = r² - CS⋅CS

An optimized algorithm could first compute: oc, C and CS (all of which are cheap).
Then compute: r², CS⋅CS then d (which are also cheap).

Then:
If d is negative, bail out early as there are no intersections.
If d is zero, bail out early, either returning C as the intersection (if oc is positive) or nothing otherwise.
if d is positive, take the square root of d and compute oi1 and oi2, then only if both are positive,
return an intersection position using the smaller one - otherwise return nothing.


| Approach 2:
=============
Define an intersection position at some distance di from the ray origin:

I = O + diD

Define a vector Ic from it to the sphere's center:

Ic = Sc - I
   = Sc - (O + diD)
   = Sc - O - diD
   = Sc - O - diD
   = OS - diD


It's length is the distance to the center of the sphere, which is always the sphere's radius:

||Ic|| = r

Squaring both sides, then substituting the square of a vector-length by it's dot product with itself, gives:

||Ic||² = r²
Ic⋅Ic = r²

Substituting Ic and expanding gives:

(OS - diD)⋅(OS - diD) = r²
OS⋅OS - diD⋅OS - OS⋅diD + diD⋅diD = r²
diD⋅diD - 2di(D⋅OS) + OS⋅OS = r²
di²(D⋅D) - 2di(OS⋅D) + OS⋅OS = r²
(D⋅D)di² + (-2OS⋅D)di + (OS⋅OS - r²) = 0
(D⋅D)di² + (-2OS⋅D)di + (||OS||² - r²) = 0

This is a quadratic equation for di:

(a)di² + (b)di + (c) = 0

Where:

a = D⋅D
b = -2(OS⋅D)
c = ||OS||² - r²

The ray direction D it typically normalized.
Dotting it with itself is equivalent to squaring it's length which is 1:

a = D⋅D
  = ||D||²
  = 1²
  = 1

Giving:

(a)di² + (b)di + (c) = 0
(1)di² + (b)di + (c) = 0
di² + (b)di + c = 0

This quadratic equation has solution:

di = (-b ±√(b² - 4ac)) / 2a
   = (-b ±√(b² - 4c)) / 2


Define a discriminant:

d = b² - 4c

di = (-b ±√d) / 2
   = -b/2 ±√d/2
   = -(-2(OS⋅D))/2 ±√d/2
   = 2(OS⋅D)/2 ±√d/2
   = (OS⋅D)2/2 ±√d/2
   = OS⋅D ±√d/2

For a negative discriminant there are no solutions implying no intersection.
For a zero discriminant there is a single solution implying an intersection:

di = OS⋅D ±√0/2
   = OS⋅D

This gives the same intersection as with approach 1:

I = O + diD
  = O + (OS⋅D)D
  = O + ((Sc - O)⋅D)D

For a positive discriminant there are 2 solutions:

di1 = OS⋅D + √d/2
di2 = OS⋅D - √d/2

√d/2 = b² - 4c
     = √( (-2(OS⋅D))(-2(OS⋅D)) - 4c )/2
     = √( (-2)(-2)(OS⋅D)(OS⋅D) - 4c )/2
     = √( 4((OS⋅D)²) - 4c )/2
     = √( 4( (OS⋅D)² - c) )/2
     = √4√( (OS⋅D)² - c )/2
     = √( (OS⋅D)² - c )√4/2
     = √( (OS⋅D)² - c )2/2
     = √( (OS⋅D)² - c )
     = √( (OS⋅D)² - (||OS||² - r²) )
     = √( (OS⋅D)² - ||OS||² + r² )

         di1 = OS⋅D + √(4*((OS⋅D)² - c))/2
         di2 = OS⋅D - √(4*((OS⋅D)² - c))/2

         di1 = OS⋅D + √4*√((OS⋅D)² - c)/2
         di2 = OS⋅D - √4*√((OS⋅D)² - c)/2

         di1 = OS⋅D + 2*√((OS⋅D)² - c)/2
         di2 = OS⋅D - 2*√((OS⋅D)² - c)/2

         di1 = OS⋅D + √((OS⋅D)² - c)*2/2
         di2 = OS⋅D - √((OS⋅D)² - c)*2/2

         di1 = OS⋅D + √((OS⋅D)² - c)
         di2 = OS⋅D - √((OS⋅D)² - c)

         di1 = OS⋅D + √((OS⋅D)² - OS⋅OS + r²)
         di2 = OS⋅D - √((OS⋅D)² - OS⋅OS + r²)

This implies 2 points of intersection:

Eq.27:   I1 = O + (b - √d)/-2*D
         I2 = O + (b + √d)/-2*D

If both roots are negative, the sphere intersects "behind" the ray origin position.
If one root is positive and the other negative, the ray origin position is "inside" the sphere.
If both roots are positive, the sphere is "in front" of the ray, and intersects it twice.
